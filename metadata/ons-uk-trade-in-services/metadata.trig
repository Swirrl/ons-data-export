Trade in services by country and service type is the most timely publication showing granular services data.

Data covers quarterly and annual data from 2016 over 31 service types and 67 countries.

Data are collated from 28 data sources with a mixture of admin and survey data from ONS and external sources. Examples include International trade in services (ITIS) survey, International Passenger Survey (IPS), Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Chamber of Shipping (CoS). ITIS is the largest data source with just over 50% of services data from this source. Further information about these sources can be found in the [release](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/internationaltrade/bulletins/exportsandimportsstatisticsbycountryforuktradeinservices/januarytomarch2019#quality-and-methodology) and in the [UK Trade Quality and Methodology Information report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/methodologies/uktradeqmi).
